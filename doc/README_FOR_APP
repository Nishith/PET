P.E.T. stands for Project Enactment Tool. It is a tool to assist in project management and progress tracking.
It leverages the project management knowledge that the company has acquired by helping project managers create
estimations of projects based on historical data and then monitor progress during the development process.

Three different roles are involved in our system: project manager, developer and admin. Firstly, project managers (PM)
can create a new project, specifying project phases to the project and deliverables to each phase. PET also provides
a set of predefined lifecycles containing certain phases and deliverables that PM can take advantage of. For each
deliverable, PM can utilize historical data to estimate the size, productivity and total effort. When the implementation
takes place, developers can log effort against a deliverable. PM can then track the total effort of deliverables to monitor
progress. Besides project management, PM can also create, edit or delete lifecycles to produce desired project
templates.

To further explore the application, please go to ProjectsController, ProjectPhasesController and
ProjectPhaseDeliverablesController to see how the major queries of the website are handled.

Design decisions:

1. Since DeliverableType is associated with specific Uom, ad-hoc deliverable will have nil as deliverable type.
2. To facilitate historical data queries, HistoricalData model is created. After a deliverable is marked as finished,
the estimations data of it (size, production rate and total effort) will be moved to HistoricalData table.
3. Once a project is created from a lifecycle, it does not have a direct link back to it. This is because if the lifecycle
changes later the changes should not affect the already existing project.
4. Deletion of a project, project phase, or a project phase deliverable is not permitted if there is logged effort for it.
