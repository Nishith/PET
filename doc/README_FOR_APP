P.E.T. stands for Project Enactment Tool. It helps project managers create estimation of projects based on historical
data and then monitor progress during the development process.

Three different roles are involved in our system: project manager, developer and admin. Firstly, project managers (PM)
can create a new project, specifying project phases to the project and deliverables to each phase. PET also provides
a set of predefined lifecycles containing certain phases and deliverables that PM can take advantage of. For each
deliverable, PM can utilize historical data to estimate the size, productivity and total effort. When the implementation
takes place, developers can log effort against a deliverable. PM then track the total effort of deliverables to monitor
progress. Besides project management, PM can also create, edit or delete lifecycles to produce desired project
templates.
